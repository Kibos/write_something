OO principles:
1) Encapsulate what varies - identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2) Program to interfaces, not implementations. 
3) Favour composition over inheritance.
4) Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
5) Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
6) Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
7) Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends.
8) Don't call us, we'll call you.
9) A class should have only one reason to change.
